1. my program is a hospital patient database that can add a new patient record, search for a patient record, edit a patient record, delete a patient
record, and exit the program. You can look up the patient ID by looking at all the patient records in the patients.csv file to get the auto-generated
ID, to be able to look up the patients file when asked to input the patient records ID. As shown in the Video I submitted of my program working.

2. there are no issues with my program.
